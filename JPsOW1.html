        <p class = "dtext col-md-6 col-sm-12">During the summers of 2016 and 2017 I worked at my local county fair in a cinnamon roll booth called "JP's Old West Cinnamon Rolls". Since my job was to be the main cashier for the booth, I had the unfortunate duty of dealing with the cash registers on a daily basis. As can be seen in the image on the left, the buttons on the booth's cash registers were arranged in no particular order. This made it very difficult to quickly find the item(s) on the register's keypad that you were looking for. The inability to quickly find the buttons on the register that matched what a customer was ordering grew frustrating to deal with as a cashier and severely slowed down our speed at fulfilling orders during peak business hours. <br><br>NOTE: Unfortunately I didn't know what a design portfolio was back when I used to work at the fair...Trust me I wish I did. To combat this tragedy I created some diagrams of what the cash registers looked like at the time.</p>

        <p class = "dtext col-md-6 col-sm-12"><br>During my second summer at the cinnamon roll booth I had finally had enough. Equipped with some basic UI/UX design knowledge I had just gained at UCI that spring, I decided to make a major change to the booth's cash registers. In order to make it easier to identify the proper button quickly, I took it upon myself to reorganize each button's position on the cash registers (with permission from my boss of course).<br><br>To accomplish this I used the Gestalt design principles of proximity and similarity. For proximity, I gave each item type its row on the cash register. As can be seen in the image of my redesign cold drinks, hot drinks, food items, and miscellaneous items now each had their own designated row. For similarity, I assigned each item type a color. Blue for cold drinks, brown for hot drinks, yellow for food, and white for misc items. I chose these colors by design because my mind tends to associate ice cold drinks with the color blue and warm beverages like coffee with the color brown. Then I chose yellow to represent food items because 1) it is also a "warm" color that could easily be associated with hot foods and 2) it contrasts well against blue and brown.</p>

            <p class = "dtext col-12"><br>The process of physcially changing the buttons on the registers was very easy. The cash registers were pretty ancient and the keypad resembled a mechanical keyboard with clear caps. Under these clear caps were little square pieces of paper with the name of an item on the menu typed onto it. Knowing this, I went home one night after my shift ended and printed out some new little square pieces of paper to put under the cash registers' keypad caps. This time each piece of paper was color coordinated to correspond to the type of item it was. As explained above, I printed the new labels for cold drinks (water, milk, soda) on blue paper, the new keypad labels for warm drinks (coffee, latte, hot chocolate) on brown paper, the new labels for food (each cinnamon roll variation) on yellow paper, and each new miscellaneous label (extra nuts, extra frosting, add latte flavoring) on white paper.  </p>

<!-- Impact -->

    <div class = "row">
        <p class = "dtext col-md-6">In the summer of 2017, my fellow employees and I went on to complete over 260 orders in a one hour span which is the most ever in the cinnamon roll booth's 20+ year history. I believe this is due not only to the amazing chemistry me and my coworkers had with each other, but also in part to the changes I made to the booth's cash registers which improved the speed at which we could take and fulfill orders. I know that to some this design project (if you'd even call it that) seems extremely simple and insignificant. I mean honestly all I did was rearrange some buttons on a cash register.</p>
        
        <p class = "dtext col-md-6">Despite that this project is something that I am extremely proud of. This is because I was able to apply some super basic design knowledge I had learned at UCI to a real world situation in order to positively change the user-experience of a system. Not only that, but to see my user-experience upgrade then in turn create more profit for the booth by enabling us take more orders per hour was what ultimately inspired my decision to pursue a degree in Informatics and a career in UI/UX design. That is why this project in particular, despite its simplicity, means so much to me and is also why I decided to include it in my design portfolio.</p>
