    <p class = "dtext col-12">This is yet another of my major assignments from my “User Interaction Software” class. This time I was tasked with using Angular and Express to create a webpage and backend server to browse music on Spotify. More specifically, the web page must support searching for artists, albums, and tracks as well as navigation between these three resources. Also, the backend server must handle authentication via OAuth and communicate with the Spotify API.<br><br>
        
The main reason I included this project in my portfolio is to showcase some valuable front-end skills I learned. Here is the<a href="https://github.com/Tyler-Valdivieso/Spotify-Browser" target="_blank"> GitHub repo</a> if you would like to view the code for yourself. Also, you can play around with the actual website<a href="https://spotifyproject-tyler.firebaseapp.com/" target="_blank"> here</a> if you would like to do so.<br><br>
        
Due to the requirements of this assignment, the website unfortunately requires my express server to be running at all times in order to work. So if I turn off my laptop for any reason the website I linked above won’t function properly. To combat this I included a demo of me using the website below. Just in case you try to use the site while the server is not up and running, you can still watch the demo to get a feel of the functionality of the site and see it being used in real time. </p>

        <h3>Design Choices<br></h3>
    </div>
    
    <div class = "row">
    <p class = "dtext col-12">Just like my Twitter site, most of my focus was geared toward the front end development of this project. Therefore, I simply just aimed to keep the design of the site clean, simple, and intuitive which I believe I accomplished. </p>

        <h3>Knowledge Gained<br></h3>
    </div>
    
    <div class = "row">
    <p class = "dtext col-12">Through completing this project I learned a great deal about Angular and using it to effectively create dynamic webpages. Learning Angular through this project was key because I have since needed to use Angular multiple times. Most notably in my “Vibes” project (which I hope you read about earlier in my portfolio) and also while I was working alongside CoreLogic during my senior design course. </p>
