        <p class = "dtext col-12">For my Human-Computer Interactions (HCI) project I teamed up with 5 other UCI students in order to redesign the user interface of an existing app or website of our choice. We quickly agreed upon GroupMe, a mobile messaging app owned by Microsoft, as our choice due to the fact that multiple members of our group had terrible user experiences while using GroupMe in the past. Our team meticulously accomplished many reseach and design based tasks (which I will be going over in more detail below) during our 10 weeks together in order to ensure our redesign was a huge improvement over what GroupMe was providing to users at the time.</p>

        <p class = "dtext col-12">The overall purpose of this course was to improve the overall usability of an existing software application by redesigning its interface. I believe my team and I accomplished this (and more importantly so did our professor) by applying usability heuristics and interface knowledge we had learned in previous courses to our GroupMe redesign.<br><br>

However, in a real world software and business aspect, I believe this redesign would have been a failure. This is because the main purpose of building and maintaining software for most companies, especially for bigger companies like Microsoft which is the parent company of GroupMe, is to make money. To make money through peer to peer chat based applications (like GroupMe) you need users. To Microsoft’s dismay, we discovered through our research and common knowledge that most people prefer to use iMessage, Facebook Messenger, Snapchat, and WhatsApp over GroupMe. In fact, many people we interviewed or surveyed had never even heard of GroupMe.<br><br>
            
I have extreme doubts that a simple overhaul of GroupMe’s interface would be enough to steal users away from powerhouses such as Facebook Messenger. A better business choice would be to redesign the app in order to appeal to a specific target audience, like how Discord appeals to gamers, rather than redesigning the interface in order to simply improve usability. With a few tweaks and an overall rebranding, GroupMe could become one of the main chat app choices for professionals and the big organizations they work for. This is because GroupMe is already one of the few chat apps that allows for hundreds of users all to be in the same chat together. </p>
