        <p class = "dtext col-md-7 col-sm-12">For a Human-Computer Interactions (HCI) project I teamed up with 5 other UCI students in order to redesign the user interface of an existing app or website of our choice. We quickly agreed upon GroupMe, a mobile messaging app owned by Microsoft, as our choice due to the fact that multiple members of our group had terrible user experiences while using GroupMe in the past. Our team meticulously accomplished many reseach and design based tasks (which I will be going over in more detail below) during our 10 weeks together in order to ensure our redesign was a huge improvement over what GroupMe was providing to users at the time.</p>

        <h3 class = "secondarytitles">Redesign Evaluation/In Retrospect</h3> 
    </div>
        
        <p class = "dtext col-12">Typically I would put a section like this at the bottom of the page, but I feel as though my retrospective thoughts about this project are by far my most important takeaways from it. Because of this, I don’t want these thoughts to get lost at the bottom of the page, never to be seen once whoever reading this gets inevitably bored from reading about our redesign process. Therefore, I put this section at the top.<br><br>
            
The overall purpose of this course was to improve the general usability of an existing software application by redesigning its interface. I believe my team and I accomplished this (and more importantly so did our professor) by applying usability heuristics and interface knowledge we had learned in previous courses to our GroupMe redesign.<br><br>

However, in a real world software and business aspect, I believe this redesign would have been a failure. This is because the main purpose of building and maintaining software for most companies, especially for bigger companies like Microsoft (the parent company of GroupMe), is to make money. To make money through peer to peer chat based applications, like GroupMe, you need users. To Microsoft’s dismay, we discovered through our research and common knowledge that most people prefer to use iMessage, Facebook Messenger, Snapchat, and WhatsApp over GroupMe. In fact, many people we interviewed or surveyed had never even heard of GroupMe.<br><br>
            
I have extreme doubts that a simple overhaul of GroupMe’s interface would be enough to steal users away from powerhouses such as Facebook Messenger. As a business, what sense does it make to invest in a UI redesign if that redesign is not going to give you back any return on your investment? A better business choice would be to redesign the app in order to appeal to a specific target audience, like how Discord appeals to gamers, rather than redesigning the interface in order to simply improve usability. I feel as though with a few tweaks and an overall rebranding, GroupMe could become one of the main chat app choices for business professionals and the big organizations they work for. This is because GroupMe is already one of the few chat apps that allows for hundreds of users all to be in the same chat together.<br><br>
Now that that’s off my chest, here’s what we were able to accomplish...

        <p class = "dtext col-sm-12">In order to truly discover what parts of GroupMe should be changed and how these changes should be implemented, we conducted a rigorous process of research and testing surrounding GroupMe's interface and users. This main deliverables of this process include our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GOaLX4YCJJ6cRxZaYDGF2rggTIbCvyrUvL-WASqATLk/edit?pli=1" target="_blank">competitve analysis</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N6bgFGa3Cl7P-LxJxpzJQvTFo1Ru_9Uf2gKtTRWgGlQ/edit?pli=1" target="_blank">userbase analysis document</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FA6C9ujDaU-lVS-1bMXUMi10YtZv2pfttDq-h3MAxgA/edit" target="_blank">my first user interview</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nmyuMlqC3YQjGxMPDyZv7ZmMpgr4IOX7WQJqbyiSGms/edit" target="_blank">my second user interview</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IJcDsY83jLHwwmHD-urbKV2gyp7CW4kBleM1aGf2yPo/edit" target="_blank">usability issues report</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q8y66VAL-mfACi7-OWFCrJU_jO6eDA8-hHXgZUyW_wA/edit" target="_blank">our final redesign</a>, and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u1hudawk9ICRgNWxg_j8r16AuVAuXs8cMBTCkBlnVUg/edit" target="_blank">final project report</a></p>

            If by some miracle you’ve made it this far into my portfolio, the last thing you probably want to do is read through the lengthy documents I’ve linked above. Therefore, if you wish to know more about our process, I will summarize the main gist of each document as succinctly as possible in an effort to save you from further reading.

        <h4><br>1. Competitive Analysis</h4>
    </div>
    
    <div class = "row">
        <p class = "dtext col-12">
            - Analyzed GroupMe for what it does well (extra features such as polls and the ability to have extremely large groups) and where it falls short compared to its competitors (countless bugs, inefficient/limited UI, etc.)<br><br>
            - Compared GroupMe side by side with its main direct (Facebook & WhatsApp) and indirect competitors (Discord & Google Hangouts) to try to unearth some reasons as to why these applications are more successful than GroupMe<br><br>
            - Discovered that GroupMe’s competitors have a much more refined and functional feature set than GroupMe. Furthermore the competitors have targeted, catered to, and cashed in on a specific audience and user base.<br><br>
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class = "row">
        <h4><br>2. Userbase Analysis & Interviews</h4>
    </div>
    
    <div class = "row">
        <p class = "dtext col-12">
            - Conducted user-interviews and a survey in order to gather further information on GroupMe’s target population, including what they like/dislike about messaging apps in general and their thoughts on GroupMe in comparison to its competition<br><br>
            - Through the interview we discovered that users value control over how they receive their messages since almost everyone we interviewed made a comment about how they absolutely loathe being spammed by messages in group chats. Also, people really like being able to simply react to messages, i.e. ‘emphasizing’ or ‘liking’ a message on iMessage, which is a feature that GroupMe does not have.<br><br>
            - Alongside our interviews we conducted a <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/uci.edu/forms/d/1jBAunip5kKL4oLchVz3pgGcpzvZzziTBNVbLV4z1tKA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">survey</a> that 35 people participated which gave us some key insights about how GroupMe stacks up against its competitors in the eyes of the public. In general, GroupMe isn’t looking too hot in comparison to its competition. Only about half of our participants had ever heard of GroupMe and NONE of our participants selected GroupMe as their preferred messaging application. Furthermore, GroupMe was selected by 7 of our participants as their least favorite messaging application. Clearly we had our work cut out for us.

    <div class = "row">
        <p class = "dtext col-12">
            - The purpose of this phase in the project was to put GroupMe’s usability to the test in order to discover and better understand potential usability issues that we can address in our redesign of the application. We accomplished this through two main methods. The first being a usability test where we had 6 different participants attempt 8 tasks in the GroupMe app. The second being a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i7BABuNGU4R7pzXG_k_CqpOjG1n40y5nDsUsUnAwoQQ/edit" target="_blank">cognitive walkthrough</a> in which all 6 team members meticulously performed three tasks on GroupMe while discussing and making note of any evident usability issues.<br><br>
            - Through the usability tests we discovered a multitude of issues with GroupMe including a lack of password verification, backwards account verification, a lack of notifications to group members other than the owner, a strange auto-muting feature, along with many other issues discussed in further detail in our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IJcDsY83jLHwwmHD-urbKV2gyp7CW4kBleM1aGf2yPo/edit" target="_blank">usability issues document</a>. In general, GroupMe just doesn’t stick to standard usability conventions which causes users to be confused at every turn. This coupled with the many bugs GroupMe has makes for a very frustrating and empty experience.

        <h4><br>4. Final Redesign</h4>
    </div>
    
    <div class = "row">
        <p class = "dtext col-12">
            - Along with addressing a multitude of GroupMe’s major bugs, we redesigned a few key aspects of the app: the way events in a group are created and the process of leaving/ending a group.<br><br>
            
            - During our usability tests many of our participants had difficulty in successfully creating group events and creating group polls. Furthermore, once users finally figured out how to create an event or poll, the navigation for creating these things completely obstructs the chat. Our redesign focused on using icons familiar to users so that they can easily find the create event/poll section and then minimizing the screen space this section takes up in order to leave the chat unobstructed. Below are images of the GroupMe’s original design of this feature alongside our redesign.

    </div>
    
    <p class = "dtext col-12">
            - From our usability tests we observed many users encountered difficulty with finding the path to leave a group. Furthermore, the creator of the group could not leave the group without ending it entirely which caused errors to be triggered with no feedback on the ends of the other group members. With this in mind our redesign gives users the option to select a potential successor as the chat group owner. This allows the remaining users to continue the conversation without creating an entirely new chat and experiencing cryptic error messages. Again, below are images from our report of GroupMe's original design side by side with our redesign.
