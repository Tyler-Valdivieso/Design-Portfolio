        <h3>Concept</h3> 
    </div>

    <div class = "row">
        <p class = "dtext col-sm-12">The inspiration to create this app came from two places. First and foremost, I've constantly been around salons due to the fact that my mother has been a hairstylist for over 25 years. As I've grown up and I've noticed many industries transition into the digital age (i.e. music streaming services, mobile banking, online shopping, etc). However, this has not been the case with the salon industry for the most part. Many salons, such as the all of the ones my mom has worked at, still use physical scheduling books to keep track of all the appointments scheduled at the salon. I find that odd and cumbersome in this era. Furthermore, I have witnessed physical appointment books lead to major miscommunication and scheduling conflicts amongst stylists who share clients. Also, forgetting their appointment back at the salon has proven to be an issue for stylists since most stylists schedule their clients while at home. Therefore, I decided to create Trim which allows stylists to create and manage their schedules directly on their mobile device. <br><br>My second source of inspiration is from multiple stylists I know personally that have asked me to create an app that allows them to keep track of their cleints and the formulas needed to maintain or change their clients' haircolors. A client contact book at its core. These are the two ideas that have merged together to form Trim.</p>

    <div class = "row">
        <p class = "dtext col-sm-12">Above are my wireframes I created for Trim. The designs are based off of the wants and needs of hair stylists I've interviewed about making an app (suggestions from my userbase) as well as the vision I had for bringing the salon industry into the digital age. Furthermore, I've refined my initial designs by implementing some minor features and design elements from similar apps I've used in the past. For example, I designed the 'Clients' contact list on Trim to be similar to the 'Contacts' app on iOS because I know many of my potential users are familiar with the 'Contacts' app which will in turn allow them to easily understand and use the contact list on Trim. I then tested the designs by having users interact with simple paper prototypes that looked very similar to my wireframes. I observed what aspects of the design worked well and which parts users had trouble with to again refine the design of Trim. The current result of this iterative design process is displayed above in my wireframes. However, I am not fully satisfied with the current design of the calendar/appointment book portion of the app. I am struggling with displaying a stylist's schedule in a way that is both sufficiently informative and makes sense from a UI/UX standpoint. Hopefully with more redesigning and fine tuning I will come up with not only a UI/UX design that I am happy with, but more importantly a design that allows my potential users to easily and efficiently manage their schedules.</p>
